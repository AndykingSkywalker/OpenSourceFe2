# Open Source Project

> For this project I have taken a pre-existing codebase and added my own features and styling to make it my own.

## How to use my app

> To use my app you can clone the repository using `git clone {url}`.

> Once you have opened the project in your IDE of choosing, Inside your terminal you **must** run `npm install` as this will install all the dependencies within the package.json file

> Once this is done you can simply use `npm start` to launch the React App

## Backend Functionality
> My react app is linked to a Backend which is a Java Springboot Application
> In order for any Axios requests to work you must have the backend running. You can find my backend here https://github.com/AndykingSkywalker/OpenSourceBE

---

> Once the backend is running you can navigate to `localhost:8088/swagger-ui/index.html` and you will see clear documentation for my Rest API
